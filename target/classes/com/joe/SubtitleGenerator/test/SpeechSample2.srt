00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I'm going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values
2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:17.000
now it's generally understood that the questions of morality questions of good and evil and right and wrong are questions about which science officially has no opinion
3
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
it is a start that science can help us get what we value
4
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:32.000
but I can never tell us what we ought to value and then consequently most people I think most people probably here think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life
5
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
questions like what is worth living for what is worth dying for what what constitutes a good life
6
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
so I'm going to argue that this is
7
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.000
illusion of the separation between science and human values is an illusion and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history
8
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:57.000
now it's often said that science cannot give us a foundation from reality and human values because science deals with fact
9
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and facts and values seem to belong to a different sphere
10
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000

11
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
it's often thought that there's no description
12
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
of the way the world is
13
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
they can tell us how the world ought to be
14
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
but
15
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
this is quite clearly untrue
16
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
but values are
17
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
certain kind of fact
18
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
that they are facts about thewell-beingof conscious creatures
19
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
why is it that we don't have ethical obligations towards rocks
